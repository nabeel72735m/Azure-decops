####DAY-2
1. What is Resource manager in azure ?
  When you perform any action in Azure (e.g., deploy a VM):

The request goes to Azure Resource Manager.

ARM authenticates and authorizes the request.

It then sends the request to the appropriate Azure service.

It returns the result to you — whether through the portal, CLI, or code.

#### in simple way - it is a interface between a user weather he is using ui,cli are api it takes all the parameter ans as a result it create a resource

2. Resource group
   A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like VMs, databases, and web apps are deployed and managed."

ex- If you're building an e-commerce site:

You might create a resource group named ECommerce-RG.

Inside it, you place:

A Web App (for frontend)

A SQL Database (for orders)

A Storage Account (for images)

A Key Vault (for secrets)

### in simple way - A Resource Group is like a folder where you keep all the things (resources) you build in Azure — like virtual machines, websites, and databases — that belong to the same project.
